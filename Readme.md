# Proof of Humanity

## Project Description

Proof of Humanity is a blockchain-based smart contract system designed to create robust human verification mechanisms that effectively prevent bot infiltration and ensure authentic user participation in decentralized applications. The system provides a tamper-proof way to verify and maintain records of human identity on the Aptos blockchain.

## Project Vision

Our vision is to establish a decentralized, trustless identity verification system that:
- Eliminates the need for centralized identity providers
- Creates a universal standard for human verification across Web3 applications
- Provides privacy-preserving identity solutions while maintaining security
- Enables fair participation in blockchain ecosystems by preventing bot manipulation
- Builds the foundation for a more equitable and authentic digital society

## Key Features

### üîê **Decentralized Verification**
- On-chain verification records stored directly on the Aptos blockchain
- No reliance on centralized authorities or third-party verification services
- Immutable verification history with transparent audit trails

### ‚è∞ **Time-Based Validity**
- Configurable verification expiry periods to maintain security
- Automatic expiration handling to prevent stale verifications
- Flexible validity periods based on verification method used

### üõ°Ô∏è **Anti-Bot Protection**
- Multiple verification methods support (biometric, social, behavioral)
- Prevents duplicate verifications for the same address
- Real-time verification status checking for instant bot detection

### üîç **Transparent Verification Status**
- Public verification checking without revealing personal data
- Clear verification timestamps and methods used
- Easy integration with other smart contracts and dApps

### üí° **Developer-Friendly**
- Simple two-function API for easy integration
- Comprehensive error handling and status codes
- Lightweight contract design optimized for gas efficiency
